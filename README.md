### Aims
This is a project-based unit in which students work individually, or in teams if the project
is a large industry project, to provide students with the skills to generate a computing
technology solution to solve one or more industry challenges specifically designed and
oriented towards computing technologies. Having an overall focus on computing
technology innovation, students will be focusing on the research and development
stages of a year-long project, this being the first part. Students will be able to select a
project from a range of industry oriented projects aligned to their chosen computing
major. Teams of students will have a staff member as the ‘supervisor’ or ‘facilitator’ to
guide their learning whilst working on their projects.

### Unit Learning Outcomes
On successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
1. Review literature and investigate topic areas relating to computing technology;
2. Justify and manage risks in the project planning and execution phases of computing
technology projects;
3. Apply research and development methods and skills to complete a research and
development report;
4. Investigate the importance of research and data ethics;
5. Synthesise work related to the computing technology projects relevant to students
major;
6. Communicate within teams and stakeholders using appropriate verbal, written and
technological approaches.

### Graduate Attributes
The Swinburne Graduate Attributes describe the capability of our graduates to use\
knowledge, skills and behaviours to contribute to society meaningfully and positively.\
They include professional, self-directed learning and future-ready skills.\
This unit contributes to the development of the following Swinburne Graduate\
Attributes:
* GA1 Communication - Verbal communication:
* GA2 Communication - Communicating using different media:
* GA3 Teamwork - Collaboration and negotiation:
* GA4 Teamwork – Teamwork roles and processes:
* GA5 Digital literacies– Information literacy:
* GA6 Digital Literacies– Technical literacy.
Other graduate attributes may be practised in the unit but are not formally taught as part\
of the unit content, nor incorporated within formal assessment.

### Content
* Literature Review in computing technologies related to students major
* Risk Analysis and Management in computing technology projects
* Research and Development Methods in computing technology
* Research Ethics in computing technology
* Technical skills relevant to students major

#### Minimum requirements to pass this Unit
To pass this unit, you must:
* achieve an overall mark for the unit of 50% or more.
* complete the project to an acceptable standard. A rubric will be used to determine if students have met the acceptable standard, and will be available on Canvas

#### Examinations
There are no formal examinations in this Unit of Study. However, there is a Capstone Expo (an assessment) in the final assessment period in Novembe

#### Submission Requirements
Assignments and other assessments are generally submitted online through the
Canvas assessment submission system which integrates with the Turn-it-in plagiarism checking service.

Please ensure you keep a copy of all assessments that are submitted.

In cases where a hard copy submission is required an Assessment Cover Sheet must be submitted with your assignment.\
The standard Assessment Cover Sheet is available from the Submitting work webpage or\
<https://www.swinburne.edu.au/studentforms/>

#### Extensions and Late Submission
Extensions to assessable items will only be granted in exceptional circumstances on medical or compassionate grounds.\
Extensions must be applied for in advance of the assessable item's due date and the convener of this Unit of Study must approve the extension in writing.

Where submissions are group submissions no extensions will be granted.

Late Submissions: unless an extension has been explicitly granted by the Unit of Study convener, you cannot submit an assessable item after the due date.\
If this does occur, you will be penalised 10% of the assessments worth for each calendar day the task is late - up to a maximum of 5 days.\
After 5 days a zero result will be recorded.\
Feedback or comments from the marker will generally not be available on assignments that are submitted after five working days past the published deadline.

#### Referencing
To avoid plagiarism, you are required to provide a reference whenever you include information from other sources in your work and acknowledge when you have used Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools (such as ChatGPT).\
Further details regarding academic integrity are available in Section C of this
document.

Referencing conventions for assessable documents are to be negotiated with the project supervisor in advance.

Helpful information on referencing can be found at:\
<http://www.swinburne.edu.au/library/referencing/>

#### Group Work Guidelines
A group assignment is the collective responsibility of the entire group, and
if one member is temporarily unable to contribute, the group should be able to reallocate responsibilities to keep to schedule.\
In the event of longer-term illness or other serious problems involving a member of group,
it is the responsibility of the other members to notify immediately the Unit Convenor or relevant tutor/supervisor.

Group submissions must be submitted with an Assignment Cover Sheet, signed by all members of the group.

All group members must be satisfied that the work has been correctly submitted.\
Any penalties for late submission will generally apply to all group members, not just the person who submitted.
